### Use HTML/CSS/Javascript to create the following:

* Make a valid HTML5 document
* Display "Hello, World" centered horizontally on the page
* Change the color of "World" to white, and give it a black background
* Using Javascript, add a greeting for each of your friends to the page, each on their own line and centered
Friends: Ray, Oscar, Gwen, Bob, and Marie
* Write each of their names in their favorite color: red, orange, green, blue, and magenta, respectively
* Add a colored background to each of their names that provides reasonable contrast with their favorite color
* Make the text bigger and add a couple of CSS styles of your choice
* You don't want to show any favoritism: randomize the order that their names appear on the page each time the page is loaded
